<h1>Woodstock 4.0.2.2 JSF Components Release Notes</h1>
<h3>Changes from 4.0.2.1</h3>
<ul><li>A security fix related to the ThemeServlet serving 404 pages was fixed.</li>
    <li>508 messages were added on some images that were not labeled causing
	their client-id's to be read by screen readers, which significantly
	impacted usuability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IE7 Button width issue</h3>
When displayed in IE7, the button component might be rendered
with an incorrect width. This problem occurs when the button is placed
using absolute positioning.For example, Netbeans with
Visual Web Pack, uses absolute positioning to place components in Grid
Layout
Mode, and in such situation this problem could occur.<br>
<br>
IE7 expects a value to be specified for the width of buttons. If
a width attribute is not specified, the width is set to width:auto,
which results in the button's width being set to the entire available
width of the button's container element.&nbsp; For example, if the
button
style has left=130px then the button will start at 130px left and will
expand to the width of the &lt;body&gt;.<br>
<h4>Workarounds</h4>
There are several workarounds that can be used in the
developer's code to solve the problem.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Specify the width attribute for the button, or resize
the button in the IDE to make the IDE assign a width to the button.</li>
  <li>Use relative positioning instead of absolute positioning on
the button component.&nbsp; For example:<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;input name="Button2" style="position:relative; left:72px;top:18px" type="button" value="Button" /&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Enclose the button inside a div or span element to
restrict the available width to the div/span element's width. Remember
to
set the positioning for the div/span element.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML Example 1:&nbsp; Button inside a div tag<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;div style="position:absolute; left:72px; top:68px"&gt;<br>  &lt;input name="Button1" type="button" value="button" /&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML Example 2:&nbsp; Button inside span tag<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;span style="position:absolute; left:72px; top:68px"&gt;<br>  &lt;input name="Button1" type="button" value="button" /&gt;<br>&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <li>In VWP IDE, drop the button into a Group Panel to put the
button inside a span tag.&nbsp; In this case no need to set the
positioning as IDE
sets the positioning for Group Panel.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>JSP Example:&nbsp;&nbsp; Button inside Group Panel component <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;webuijsf:panelGroup binding="#{Page1.groupPanel1}" id="groupPanel1" style="position:absolute; left:240px; top:168px"&gt;<br>  &lt;webuijsf:button binding="#{Page1.button1}" id="button1" text="Button"/&gt;<br>&lt;/webuijsf:panelGroup&gt;</pre>
